This code is a Python script that performs breast cancer prediction using various machine learning algorithms. Here's a summary of the code:

    1. The code starts by importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

    2. It reads a breast cancer dataset from a CSV file and performs data preprocessing steps like handling missing values, dropping unnecessary columns, and encoding the target variable.

    3. The code then performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) by visualizing the correlation matrix and dropping highly correlated features.

    4.  After EDA, the dataset is split into training and testing sets.

    5. The code then trains and evaluates the following machine learning models on the dataset:

        >> K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
        >> Logistic Regression
        >> Random Forest
        >> Decision Tree
        >> Naive Bayes
        >> Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    6. For each model, the code calculates the accuracy score, prints the classification report, and visualizes the confusion matrix.

    7. The code also includes a function to compare the accuracies of all the models using a bar plot.

    8. Additionally, the script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library, where users can input feature values and predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the trained KNN model.

    9. The GUI provides buttons to train and evaluate other models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) and display their respective accuracies and classification reports.

    10. The code also includes functions to reset the input fields and compare the accuracies of different models.

Overall, this code demonstrates the implementation of various machine learning algorithms for breast cancer prediction, along with data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model evaluation, and a user-friendly GUI for making predictions.
